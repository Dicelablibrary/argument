      <p>Dear Participant,</p>

      <p>
      I would like to thank you for taking the time to complete this study. The following is a description of some of the psychological research and theory that led to this study and provides you with further information about the goals of this study.      </p>

      <p>
      We sought to investigate what sorts of persuasive arguments are the most effective long-term. We chose the topic of legalizing kidney markets as most people are opposed to them while most economists are in favour of them. We also wanted to examine how different persuasive techniques affect those with different thinking styles differently. 
      </p>

      <p>
      We hypothesized that:
        <ol>
          <li>1. All persuasive techniques will change short-term attitudes.</li>
          <li>2. Arguments that emphasize logic will be more persuasive when they are emphasizing deontology (moral intentions) than when they are emphasizing utilitarianism (moral consequences).</li>
          <li>3. Intuitive arguments will be more persuasive than logical ones.</li>
          <li>4. Intuitive thinkers will be more persuaded by intuitive-like arguments.</li>
          <li>5. Rational thinkers will be more persuaded by rational arguments.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
      We had no hypotheses surrounding the personality questions that you answered. The questionnaire was administered mainly to provide some time before the first and second time you were asked about your attitudes toward legal kidney markets. We did this because people generally want to be consistent, and we wanted to space both attitude questions out so that you wouldnâ€™t be thinking of the first time you answered how you felt about kidney markets to interfere with the second time you were asked.
      </p>

      <p>
      In this study, we had five conditions. Participants engaged with an AI chatbot In four of the conditions. Within these conditions, the AI made either emotional, narrative, deontological, or utilitarian arguments. The remaining condition was a control condition where participants had to write how they felt about kidney markets in lieu of arguing with an AI.

      This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee (ORE# 46093). If you have questions for the committee, contact the Office of Research Ethics, toll-free at 1-833-643-2379 (Canada and USA), 1-519-888-4440, or reb@uwaterloo.ca.

      <p>
      Your identity will be confidential. Furthermore, because the interest of this study is in the average responses of the entire group of participants, you will not be identified individually in any way in any written reports of this research. The data, with identifying information removed, will be kept for a period of at least 7 years following publication of the research, after which it will be deleted. The data will be securely stored to which only researchers associated with this study have access.
      </p>

      <p>
      De-identified data related to your participation will be submitted to an open access repository (OSF) or journal (i.e., the data may be publicly available). These data will be completely deidentified/anonymized prior to submission and will be presented in aggregate form in publications. This process is integral to the research process as it allows other researchers to verify results and avoid duplicating research. Other individuals may access these data by accessing the open access repository. Although the dataset without identifiers may be shared publicly, your identity will always remain confidential.

      <p>
      Please remember that any data pertaining to you as an individual participant will be kept confidential. Once all the data are collected and analyzed for this project, my team plans on sharing this information with the research community through seminars, conferences, presentations, and journal articles. If you are interested in receiving more information regarding the results of this study, or would like a summary of the results, please provide your email address, and when the study is completed, we will send you the information. In the meantime, if you have any questions about the study, please do not hesitate to contact us by email as noted below.
